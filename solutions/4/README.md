# Problem 4 - Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91  99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## Solution

I'm not totally proud of this solution, but it works. I call it a hack because it's basically checking every possibility. It's blind. I will come up with a better and more general solution -_-
