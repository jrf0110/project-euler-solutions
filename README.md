# My project euler solutions

Just keeping track of my solutions to Euler. I'm trying to provide general forms of every problem so the parameters of the problem do not matter. You can just pass in different ones in the solution function.

I'm also trying to write how I came to my solutions. Just browse the solutions folder. Each solution has its own readme.

To run:

```
node app
```

To use:

```
var euler = require('./');

euler[1]();
```
